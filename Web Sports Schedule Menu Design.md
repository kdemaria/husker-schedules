I have created a Sports Schedules tab on the web site.

It works like this.

1. I use this [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) (sonnet 4.5) prompt to scrape the cornhusker website, and generate a package of .csv files and a summary index.html file, which is zipped up for easy downloading.  Use extended thinking for the most accurate results.

   ***We are going to create some sports schedules in CSV format for the University of Nebraska football, baseball, softball, mens basketball, womens basketball, and volleyball.*** 

   

   ***Only consider the 2025-2026 seasons.*** 

   

   ***If a season has ended as of the current date, use the next season's schedule.*** 

   

   ***verify that all schedules are current as of today's date. If any games show as 'scheduled' but the date has passed, search for the actual results and update the schedule accordingly.***

   ***Use the official University of Nebraska, [espn.com](http://espn.com), and [HuskerMax.com](http://huskermax.com/) to validate data.***

   

   ***Create a separate csv for each sport listed above.***

    

   ***Name each file in the format "Sportname.csv".*** 

   

   ***Each CSV should contain the following header: Date, Day, Opponent, Home/Away, Location, Venue, Time, Event, Result*** 

   

   ***Create an .html document that lists data in each of the CSVs as a Sports Schedule, by sport in a nicely formatted and Nebraska Branded format.***

   

   ***Place each csv and the html file in a folder titled "schedule-sources", and then compress the folder into a file called scheduled-sources.zip and make that available for download.***

2. I download it, unzip it, and place it on a public web server. Currently a folder hidden on [https://www.demaria.net/schedule-sources/](https://www.demaria.net/schedule-sources/)   
3. In google Workspace I created a single google sheet which reads these CSVs and imports their data into a table readable by a wordpress tool [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di3pSc4t\_uX8LibDurD2bxbB9TzLMmwhSar3UpTaTTU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di3pSc4t_uX8LibDurD2bxbB9TzLMmwhSar3UpTaTTU/edit?usp=sharing)  
4. In wordpress, I installed FlexTable which can read a google sheet and display itâ€™s data real time.
