TASK: Create verified sports schedule in tabular format for University of Nebraska Athletics {{SPORT_NAME}} current season based on today's date. Validate today's date before you start using multiple sources.

SPORT: {{SPORT_NAME}}

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- For ALL past games (before today): MUST include verified results from multiple sources
- Cross-reference at least 2-3 sources for every result
- If sources conflict, use huskers.com as the authoritative source
- NEVER guess or fabricate scores - mark uncertain data as "Unable to verify"
- Check for logical consistency (no duplicate opponents unless legitimate series/tournament)

Before finalizing the schedule, perform date arithmetic:
1. Identify the current date
2. For EVERY game where the date is BEFORE the current date:
   - The game MUST have a result
   - If the official schedule shows it without a result, DO NOT TRUST IT
   - Immediately search for the actual game result using multiple queries
   - Try searches like: "[team] vs [opponent] [date] final score"
   - Try: "[team] [date] game result"
   - Check ESPN, team websites, news sources
   - Keep searching until you find the verified result
3. If after extensive searching (5+ queries) you still cannot find a result:
   - Note this as "Result not found - may be postponed/cancelled"
   - Document the search attempts made
