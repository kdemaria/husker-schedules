We are going to create sports schedules for University of Nebraska Athletics in CSV format. We will be creating the CSVs for the following sports: Football, Baseball, Softball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, and Volleyball.

For each sport, include the current active season:
- For sports currently in season: Include all games from the current season (both past results and future scheduled games)
- For sports in their off-season: Include the upcoming season's schedule
- Today's date is your reference point - include results for all games that have already been played

IMPORTANT - Verify that all schedules are current as of today's date. For any games where the date has already passed, you MUST search for and include the actual game results. Do not leave the Result column blank for past games.

Research game results from these sources:
- https://huskermax.com - for game dates, scores, and results
- https://huskers.com (official University of Nebraska Athletics site)
- https://espn.com - for schedules, scores, and game results
- Search the web for recent game results if needed

Create a separate CSV for each sport listed above.

Name each file in the format "Sportname.csv" (e.g., "Football.csv", "Baseball.csv").

Each CSV should contain the following header: Date, Day, Opponent, Home/Away, Location, Venue, Time, Event, Result

For the Result column:
- For games that have already been played (dates in the past): Include the final score in the format "W 24-17" or "L 10-21" (W/L followed by Nebraska's score first, opponent's score second)
- For future games (dates that haven't occurred yet): Leave the Result column empty or use "TBD"
- Make sure to research and include actual game results for ALL past games - do not leave results blank for games that have already been played

Create an HTML document that lists data in each of the CSVs as a Sports Schedule, by sport in a nicely formatted and Nebraska Branded format. Use Nebraska's colors (Scarlet #E41C38 and Cream #FEFDFA) and include the Nebraska "N" logo aesthetic if possible.

IMPORTANT: Return each file as a code block in your response using the following format:

```csv:Football.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Baseball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Softball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:MensBasketball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:WomensBasketball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Volleyball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```html:index.html
[HTML content here]
```

Make sure each code block has a language identifier (csv or html) followed by a colon and the filename.
