CRITICAL: Accuracy is paramount. For EVERY game, especially those with results:
- Cross-reference at least 2-3 different sources before recording a result
- If sources conflict, use the official Nebraska Athletics site (huskers.com) as the authoritative source
- Never guess or fabricate results - if you cannot verify a result, mark it as "TBD" with a note
- After completing each schedule, review it once more for logical consistency (e.g., no duplicate opponents on different dates unless it's a tournament/series)
```
IMPORTANT: Return each file as a code block in your response using the following format:

```csv:Football.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Baseball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Softball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:MensBasketball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:WomensBasketball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Volleyball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```html:index.html
[HTML content here]
```

Make sure each code block has a language identifier (csv or html) followed by a colon and the filename.
### 2. **Break the Task Into Phases**
Instead of asking for everything at once, try:
```
Phase 1: Research and verify all schedules, creating separate CSVs
Phase 2: Review each CSV for accuracy and consistency
Phase 3: Create the HTML document using the verified CSVs
```

### 3. **Add Quality Control Checkpoints**
```
Before finalizing each CSV:
- Verify no team appears twice on different dates (unless it's a legitimate series)
- Confirm all past game results match multiple reliable sources
- Check that game times and TV networks are accurate for completed games
- Ensure Location and Venue are consistent and correct
```

### 4. **Be More Specific About Source Priority**
```
Source Priority (use in this order when conflicts arise):
1. Official Nebraska Athletics site (huskers.com)
2. Official opponent team websites
3. ESPN and major sports networks
4. Other sports sites

When recording results for past games, verify from at least TWO of these sources.
```

### 5. **Add Explicit Instructions for Handling Past vs Future Games**
```
For games that have already occurred (before October 28, 2025):
- You MUST search for and include actual results
- Include the final score in the Result column
- Verify the result from multiple sources
- If you cannot find a verified result, mark as "Result not verified" rather than guessing

For future games:
- Leave Result column empty
- Include scheduled time and TV network if available
```

### 6. **Request a Summary/Verification Report**
```
After creating each CSV, provide a brief verification report including:
- Total games in schedule
- Number of completed games with results
- Number of future games
- Any data you were unable to verify
- Any inconsistencies you noticed
```

### 7. **Add a Warning Against Hallucination**
```
CRITICAL WARNING: Do NOT create fictional scores or results. Do NOT guess at outcomes. 
If you cannot find verified information for a past game, explicitly state this rather 
than making up data. Accuracy is more important than completeness.
```
