We are going to create some sports schedules in CSV format for the University of Nebraska Football, baseball, softball, mens basketball, Women's Basketball, and Volleyball.

Only consider the 2025-2026 seasons.

If a season has ended as of the current date, use the next season's schedule.

verify that all schedules are current as of today's date. If any games show as 'scheduled' but the date has passed, search for the actual results and update the schedule accordingly.

Use the https://huskermax.com web site to validate game dates and scores.

Use the official University of Nebraska, espn.com to validate data.

Create a separate csv for each sport listed above.

Name each file in the format "Sportname.csv".

Each CSV should contain the following header: Date, Day, Opponent, Home/Away, Location, Venue, Time, Event, Result

Create an .html document that lists data in each of the CSVs as a Sports Schedule, by sport in a nicely formatted and Nebraska Branded format.

IMPORTANT: Return each file as a code block in your response using the following format:

```csv:Football.csv
[CSV content here]
