We are going to create sports schedules for University of Nebraska Athletics in CSV format. We will be creating the CSVs for the following sports: Football, baseball, softball, mens basketball, Women’s Basketball, and Volleyball. 

Only consider the 2025-2026 seasons. 

If a season has ended as of the current date, use the next season's schedule. 

verify that all schedules are current as of today's date. If any games show as 'scheduled' but the date has passed, search for the actual results and update the schedule accordingly.

Use the https://huskermax.com web site to validate game dates and scores.

Use the official University of Nebraska, espn.com to validate data. 

Create a separate csv for each sport listed above.
 
Name each file in the format "Sportname.csv". 

Each CSV should contain the following header: Date, Day, Opponent, Home/Away, Location, Venue, Time, Event, Result 

Create an .html document that lists data in each of the CSVs as a Sports Schedule, by sport in a nicely formatted and Nebraska Branded format.

IMPORTANT: Return each file as a code block in your response using the following format:

```csv:Football.csv
[CSV content here]
```

```csv:Baseball.csv
[CSV content here]
```

(continue for all sports...)

```html:index.html
[HTML content here]
```

Make sure each code block has a language identifier (csv or html) followed by a colon and the filename.
